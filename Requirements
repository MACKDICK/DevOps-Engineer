  Create a Redis cluster with 1 master and 3 slaves
  The cluster should have the capability to promote slaves to master automatically in the event of master going down for whatever reason.
  Once complete please create a cloudformation template to launch the entire infrastructure.
  Automate the whole process using chef recipes.

Outcome:
